##       PROBLEMS ON 1D ARRAYS
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Sort 0,1 in linear time.
2. Sort 0,1,2 in linear time. 

1. WAP to find intersection of two arrays.
       a. Sort and use two pointers
       
2. WAP to merge two sorted arrays.
       a. Use extra space and two pointers.
       b. Explain  we used extra space but this
           can be done without extra space.
       c. We will look at how we can do it later.

3. WAP to rotate array k steps clockwise
                - Using extra space
                - Shift right k times 
                - Reverse 0-n-k, k-n and 0-n. ( Explain how making a reverse function with start and end index passing array by reference helps)
