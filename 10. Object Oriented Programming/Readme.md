# Object Oriented Programming / Paradigm / Approch 

## Different approches to develope software?
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Object oriented programming **
2. Prodcedural programming 
3. Functional programming [payment gateways are classic examples ]
4. Machine learning 

## Object: 
    - Instance of a class 
    - Object is a construct which mimics a real world entity.
## Class:
    - It's a blueprint / overall map 
    - example: A car blueprint lays down every technical and non-technical specification of the car and now using this blueprint , the factory can produce N number of cars.
    - A class has 2 broad division :
        - Class members aka fields, features
        - Methods aka Member function

Features: Are used for identifying objects 

Q: Which out of class and Object occpies memory?
Ans: Object takes memory 

## Features of OOP in details
## 1. Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details 
- Reason to abstract :
    - Abstraction reduces complexity of code by hiding unnecessary details 
    - It also reduces the impact of change.
    - **Security**: At times we don't want critical thinks to be visible to other people.
    - **Loosely-Coupled System**: 
    - **Intefaces and Abstract Classes are mechanism to bring abstraction in code.**
- Data Hiding: Using Access specifiers we achieve data hiding in Java.
    - private 
    - protected
    - public 
    - default : 

## Polymorphism 
    - Compile time polymorpism 
    - Runtime polymorphism 

## Object Class : java.lang
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- clone()
- hashCode()
- equals()
- ...

## GC: breif intro 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- static vs non-static function 

- Island of isolation ?
- shadow class
