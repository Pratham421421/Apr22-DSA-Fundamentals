# Access Modifiers in Java

- **Private:** The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

- **Default:(aka package-private)** The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

- **Protected:** The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

- **Public:** The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.


## Points to Remember:
1. **Classes in java are allowed to use only the "public" or "default" access modifier.**
2. Class members i.e variables and methods are allowed to use any of the four access modifiers.
