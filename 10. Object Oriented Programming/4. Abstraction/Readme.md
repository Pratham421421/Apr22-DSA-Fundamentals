## 1. Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details 
- Reason to abstract :
    - Abstraction reduces complexity of code by hiding unnecessary details 
    - It also reduces the impact of change.
    - **Security**: At times we don't want critical thinks to be visible to other people.
    - **Loosely-Coupled System**: 
    - **Intefaces and Abstract Classes are mechanism to bring abstraction in code.**
